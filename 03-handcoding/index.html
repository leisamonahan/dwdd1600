    <h1>History of Roller Skating</h1>
    <p>Joseph Merlin invented roller skates in Belgium in the 1760s.  Around that same time, many others also created versions of shoes with wheels attached to them. Many of the early versions of roller skates had the wheels aligned in the middle of the shoe, creating an inline skate. M. Petibled received the first patent for his roller skates.  The patent was for a wooden block with three inline wheels attached to the bottom.  This block of wood could then be attached to a shoe.  These very early versions of skates did not earn much popularity as stopping and turning was very difficult.</p>
    <p>In 1863, James Plimpton of Medford, Massachusetts invented a more practical version of roller skates.  He created trucks to attach the wheels to boots, this similar to the way that modern roller skate wheels and skate board wheels are attached.  By creating the trucks, he also was able to stray away from the inline wheel alignment and used two sets of two parallel wheels.  This wheel configuration is what we now call quad skates.</p>
   <h2>Timeline: From the Beginning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1743:</strong> This is the first ever recorded account of anyone using anything like roller skates. These first skates were used in a London stage performance, and the inventor is unknown.</li>
        <li><strong>1760:</strong> The first roller skates are invented! Though the first account was in the stage performance, this is the first ever actual invention of what we know today. These skates were actually inline, believe it or not, and had small metal wheels. The inventor was John Joseph Merlin.  </li>
        <li><strong>1819:</strong> First patented roller skate design, in France by M. Petitbled. These skates are more similar to what we know today. It was very difficult to maneuver in this early design, and was difficult to do much else but move in a straight line.</li>
        <li><strong>1857:</strong> Roller skating has finally gained enough popularity by this point and has warranted the opening of the first public rinks! They were held at The Strand in London and Floral Hall.</li>
        <li><strong>1863:</strong> The quad roller skate makes its first appearance. Designed by James Leonard Plimpton in New York City, this model of roller skate made it easier for the skater to turn.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1880:</strong> Roller skates are beginning to be mass produced in America, and is experiencing a boom in popularity.</li>
        <li><strong>1902:</strong> The Chicago Coliseum opens a public skating rink, and more than 7,000 people attend the grand opening.</li>
        <li><strong>1916:</strong> The first appearance of roller skates on the big screen is in the Charlie Chaplain film, “The Rink.”</li>
        <li><strong>1979:</strong> Scott Olson and Brennan Olson set out to redesign the skate by using a 1960's inline skate design and using modern materials and an ice hockey boot. Scott Olson begins promoting the skate, and creates Rollerblade, Inc.</li>

    <h2>Types of Roller Skates</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Roller Derby Skates</dt>
        <dd>Roller derby skate is used for intense sporting wheel activities</dd>
        <dt>Jam Skates</dt>
        <dd>Jam skates are created lightweight and have a low cut within the ankle region which permit enough room for motion</dd>
        <dt>Speed Skates</dt>
        <dd>Speed skates are explicitly created for speed. They have a “close to foot fit,” which creates a striking resemblance with a normal shoe than with most skate boots.</dd>
        <dt>Artistic Skates</dt>
        <dd>Artistic skates are created with the old fashion style of silhouette, which is basically what comes to your mind when you think of a roller skate.</dd>
        <dt>Rhythm Skates</dt>
        <dd>This type of skate has a striking resemblance to an artistic skate. the rhythm skates are used for old school moves, which are also known as rhythm skates, shuffles skate, or the R&B skate.</dd>
        <dt><a href="recreational.html#rec">Outdoor Skates</a></dt>
        <dd>Outdoor skates differ from indoor skates on the size and type of wheel used.</dd>
