    <h1>Recreational Roller Skating</h1> 
    <h2 id="rec">Outdoors</h2>
    <p>Roller skating can be done indoors or outdoors. Skating outdoors allows for a constant change of scenery while traveling around on sidewalks or bike paths, but can also pose other complications.  Rocks and debris on the pathway create tripping hazards, seams and cracks in cement can also cause for uneven and less smooth surface for the wheels to travel across.  Learning to negotiate the ups and downs of hills also requires more adaptation and can lead to fast speeds and high levels of exertion.  Weather is also a factor in the success of outdoor roller skating.</p> 
    <h2>Indoors</h2>
    <p>Roller rinks allow for a more predictable skating experience.  The indoor facilities have a smooth surface that is an ideal for the wheels to roll across.  Although hills, weather and debris aren’t a concern at roller rinks, one of the biggest draw backs is the size of crowds that can gather on a rink.  Learning to weave around the many other skaters, often of varying skill levels, requires skaters to always be alert and aware of those around them.</p>
    <h2>Who is Roller Skating for?</h2>
    <p>Roller skating can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  Children as young as 3 can begin learning to roller skate.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10215731411621335&id=1324504847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edna Davoll</a> at the age of 81, went viral as a video of her celebrating her birthday at her local skating was seen by more than 2 million viewers.  Edna proves that roller skating can also be enjoyed for many, many years.</p>
    <p>Roller rinks are a popular location for children's birthday parties.  Beginning in the 1960's, it became almost a rite of passage for a child to enjoy at least one birthday with their friends and family at the roller rink.</p>
    <h2>Roller Skating Resurge</h2>
    <p>The popularity of roller skating grew during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/05/roller-skating-surges-in-popularity-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Ben Harris</a>, manager of <em>Slick Willie’s</em> skate shop, demand for roller skates on the store’s website increased by 1,017 percent in 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  Along with many other items, roller skates became difficult to find in stock at many stores and websites.  As many styles and trends from the 80’s and 90’s were making a comeback, toss in the many months of people looking for ways to entertain themselves while businesses and schools were closed, roller skating gained a lot of attention.</p>
    <h2>Basics of Learning How to Skate</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your feet shoulder width apart.</li>
        <li>Bend you knees and squat slightly. This will give you a bit more spring, and aid your balance.</li>
        <li>Find a sweet spot with this general stance that you feel comfortable with.</li>
        <li>To start rolling around the rink, position your toes outward and your heels inward.</li>
        <li>Practice walking like this until you find your balance. You may fall a few times trying to get it just right, but that’s what the pads are for! After a while, you will gain more confidence and be well on your way.</li>
        <li>Start to move your feet more quickly, and take longer strides.</li>
        <li>Begin to push off harder with one foot while you glide on the other. Glide farther and farther distances</li>
    </ol>
