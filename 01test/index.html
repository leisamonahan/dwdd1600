      <p>
        Graphic Design is simply the art of<em> creating graphics;</em> or
        producing visuals on a surface. This can be done on
        canvas,stone,pottery,or-perhaps most commonly recognized today-on a
        computer screen.With so many different media to work with,the artistics
        method of graphic design covers visuals from drawings and symbol, to
        graphs and charts, custom logo design, book cover design, and more.
      </p>

      <h2>Grahic Design Roots: 15,000-3,600 BC</h2>
      <p>
        Graphic design can be traced all the way back to 15,000 BC, when the
        first known visual communications arose. These pictographs and symbols
        are present in the Lascaux caves in southern France. Fast-forward
        several thousand years, and you’ll discover the Blau Monument. It’s the
        first known artifact to use both words and pictures on it. Of course,
        these designed pieces are far from what we think of as graphic design
        today; but they helped spark the idea of placing images on surfaces,
        putting us on the path towards things like drawings, posters, banners,
        and more.

      <h3>Paper and Printing: 105 AD-1530 AD</h3>
      <p>
        The invention of paper in 105 AD by a Chinese man led to the concept of
        printing. Nearly a millennium later (in 1045 AD), moveable type was
        invented, which allowed characters to be placed individually for
        printing. This led to faster printing options and more flexible,
        efficient systems. By 1276, a paper mill arrived in Fabriano, Italy —
        officially bringing printing to Europe. It was in 1450, two hundred
        years after that first paper mill arrived in Europe, that the system for
        printing type in books was considered to be perfected. The first
        illustrations in a printed book followed shortly after, in 1460. Seventy
        years of printing went by before Claude Garamond opened the very first
        type foundry — in 1530 — which created and sold fonts to printers.

      <h4>The Industrial Revolution 1760-1800</h4>
      <p>
        The Industrial Revolution hit in the 1760s, and ushered in a new age for
        graphic design. Innovative technologies began popping up at an
        unprecedented rate; including the method of lithography, which was a
        printing technique that helped reduce costs. The Industrial Revolution
        also welcomed the printing press in 1800, a machine that not only
        reduced labor by 90%, but also doubled the size of paper that could be
        printed.
      </p>
      <h5>Growth of Graphic Design: 1900s</h5>
      <p>
        Since the time of the Industrial Revolution, graphic design had been
        easing its way into business practices, and in the 1900s, its use
        exploded. In 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright released “The Art and Craft of the
        Machine,” which included basic principles still referenced in modern
        design. With the growth of the advertising industry and color printing,
        businesses began creating logos to help brand their company. With a
        custom logo design, your company’s brand became more than just a name —
        it became a striking and memorable piece of art, with color, shape, and
        composition all working towards making an impression on consumers.
        Naturally, graphic design became widely used in advertising and other
        industries, marking beautiful designs on everything from posters to
        t-shirts, record covers, and more. As computer technology was invented
        and released throughout the late 1900s, designers began using
        <a href="tools.html#tool">digital tools</a> — such as Photoshop, which
        was first released in 1990 — to create their images. These digital tools
        revolutionized the field.

      <h6><strong>Graphic Design Today</strong></h6>
      <p>
        Today, graphic design refers mainly to designing visuals for magazines,
        books, advertisements, and digital posters. This intensive branch of
        design involves the art form of communicating ideas through visuals and
        text. Graphic designers still use drawings and paintings in some cases,
        but much of graphic design today is completed using digital
        technologies. These modern graphic design skills can be applied to
        custom logo design, book cover design, magazine layouts, billboard
        advertisements, clothing design, online banner ads, and much more.
        Graphic design has been around for quite some time, but as we view it
        today in the world of business, it’s only been alive for the last
        hundred years or so. Over those hundred years, graphic design has
        permeated the space of business and consumerism, grabbing our
        attentions, sparking our interests, or sometimes, blending seamlessly
        into our surroundings. It’s all around us; unless you’re looking for it,
        you may not realize how often it shows up in your daily life. Most
        likely, we can’t even begin to imagine where graphic design will take us
        in the future — after all, do you think the people printing words onto
        paper on the first paper mill could have imagined designing the digital
        banner ads, web pages, and branded logos we now skim past every day?

      <strong>Bauhaus School in Germany</strong>
      <p>
        Founded by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus launched a new way of thinking
        that combined arts and crafts, classical and avant-garde styles, form
        and function.
